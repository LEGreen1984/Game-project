            <p id="dialogue">So... this is Kiyoko the wife of Kenji. She doesn't look at me as she walks towards the chair. When I say her name she flinches like an abused puppy. Her eyes are bloodshot. She's been crying a lot. I couldn't imagine this woman being able to face a spider, let alone murder her husband. Then again... the great thing about poison is you don't need a lot of courage. All you're doing is pouring a bottle into a bowl. No different to adding pepper. Until they drop dead.<br><br>Kiyoko...why do you look so on edge? Is it because you're really the damsel in distress... or you think playing that part will hide what you've done?</p>
