# Game-project

The project was to create a text adventure, where you have to interrogate a number of characters, and make a decision 
on whether they are innocent or guilty at the end. If you guess correctly, you'll be taken to a 'win' screen, and if you lose
you'll be taken to the the 'lose screen'.

This game was built using atom, CSS, JS and HTML. The instructions on how to download atom can be found at the following website: https://atom.en.softonic.com/download.

The main mechanics behind the dialogue tree were simple if and else if statements. All the question and answer points were put into an array, and the items were assigned to buttons. Clicking a button would trigger a 'click' event, and this would trigger a function which changed the questions and answers depending on the inner HTML of the buttons.

This game was created by Laura Green.
